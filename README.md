# Computer-Graphics
Working on javaScript.

All the files in this repository contains the basic 2D program of graphics. 
You can simply open and run these with Visual Studio code.
Use these Steps:
1) Download the Repository and Open the folder in VS code.
2) Right click on html file (main.html)   
2.1) In main.html write the name of the js file you want to open.
                  <script src = "file_name"><script>

3) Click on "Open with Line Server" or Use Shortcut Alt+L / Alt+O. You will see the output on your webpage.
Note: there is a chance that you will not have above option. Line server is a VS code module you have to download. 
So, In VS code go to "extensions", Download module "Line Server" which have purple icon then rerun from step 2.


The folder have one html file and 4 js file.

js file "moving_ball" and "sphere_on_click" explores the functionality of 
callback (Event Listener) on mouseover, mouseout, mouseclicked, onkeyboard.

file name "SAZombie" is a dummy of "plant vs zombie game" which was created to
better understand the concept of Sprite Animation taught in class. I have used
the sprite sheet of a Zombie.

file name "ObjatHelixPath" was created when we were studying about the parametric equations.
Thus here i have simply moved an image which contains several leaves along a
Helix path. You can change this path by using the desired path formula on both
x,y,z axis in the "points.push(new THREE.vector3(x,y,z));"
